The stylesheets use [Sass (.scss)](http://sass-lang.com/), which is a CSS preprocessor. This allows us to use modules, variables, and several other improvements. It's syntax is very similar to CSS: http://sass-lang.com/guide. The primary file is `main.scss`, which is compiled into the `style.css` file.

```
sass --watch main.scss style.css
```
